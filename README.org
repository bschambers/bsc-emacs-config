#+title: B. S. Tancham - My Emacs Configuration

* Emacs Setup

The default init file is here:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
~/.emacs.d/init.el
#+END_SRC

It contains only one line - to load my actual init file, which is stored in a
version controlled directory:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(load-file "~/.emacs.d/init/init.el")
#+END_SRC

This file loads all of the other config files, and also loads another file which
does private config (email setup etc) and is not under version control.

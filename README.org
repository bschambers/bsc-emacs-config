* My emacs configuration

My init file is stored here:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
~/.emacs.d/init.el
#+END_SRC

Stuff created by CUSTOMISE and other automatic emacs stuff gets put in here.

At the bottom I put in a couple of lines like this to load my custom config
files, which are stored in two sub-directories.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
;; general setup
(load-file "~/.emacs.d/init-bsc/init.el")

;; private things such as email config
(load-file "~/.emacs.d/init-bsc-private/init-private.el")
#+END_SRC

First, all general config is run - that's what is in this repository.

The second line loads any private config e.g. email setup.
